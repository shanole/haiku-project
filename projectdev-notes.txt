How to count number of syllables:
--- Count the number of vowels in a word
  --- Account for "y" as a vowel
--- Subtract any silent vowels
  --- Silent "e"
  --- Second vowel when two vowels are together (that aren't diphthongs eg "ee")
--- All diphthongs count as 1 syllable
--- The number of vowel sounds left is the same as the number of syllables


The number of syllables that you hear when you pronounce a word is the same as the number of vowels sounds heard. For example:
The word "came" has 2 vowels, but the "e" is silent, leaving one vowel sound andone syllable.
The word "outside" has 4 vowels, but the "e" is silent and the "ou" is a diphthong which counts as only one sound, so this word has only two vowels sounds and therefore, two syllables
